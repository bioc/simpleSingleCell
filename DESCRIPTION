Description: 
        Once a proud workflow package, this is now a shell of its former self.
        Almost all of its content has been cannibalized for use in the
        "Orchestrating Single-Cell Analyses with Bioconductor" book at
        https://osca.bioconductor.org. Most vignettes here are retained as
        reminders of the glory that once was, also providing redirection for
        existing external links to the relevant OSCA book chapters.
