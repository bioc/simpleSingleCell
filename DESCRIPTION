Description: This workflow implements a low-level analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data using scran, scater and other Bioconductor packages.
             It describes how to perform quality control on the libraries, normalization of cell-specific biases, basic data exploration 
             and cell cycle phase identification. Procedures to detect highly variable genes, significantly correlated genes and 
             subpopulation-specific marker genes are also shown. These analyses are demonstrated on a range of publicly available scRNA-seq data sets.
